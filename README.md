Scroll Layer 2 Network
Welcome to the Scroll Layer 2 Network repository! Scroll is its own Layer 2 network built on Ethereum, specifically a "zero-knowledge rollup." It operates as a scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs while maintaining security and decentralization.

Features
Zero-Knowledge Rollup: Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to aggregate multiple transactions off-chain into a single proof validated on the Ethereum mainnet.
EVM Compatibility: Compatible with Ethereum's Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode, allowing for seamless development and deployment of smart contracts and decentralized applications.
Scalability: Enhances Ethereum's throughput by processing transactions off-chain and committing proofs to the Ethereum mainnet.
Decentralization: Maintains the decentralization and security guarantees of the Ethereum blockchain while improving scalability.
